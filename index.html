<p> 
  I'm an active member of the open-source community,
  a programmer, a musician and a writer of educational books.
</p>

<p>
  My main interests are geometric construction, computer programming, </br>
  l-systems, zero waste and permaculture. </br>

<p>
  I learned the essentials of programming with Python and Tkinter; </br>
  however, I'm currently using C++ and the Qt framework. </br>
  My main interests are user interface design and customization.
</p>

<p> 
  I've put a lot of effort into improving 
  <a href="https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD">LibreCAD</a> 
  over the past year. </br>
  I'm hoping the intersection algorithms can be improved soon. </br>
  Then I can use it for the exploration of geometric construction, </br>
  which will allow me to make more progress on my book.
</p>

<p>  
  I recently started working on a cross-platform Qt based program </br>
  for l-systems and 
  <a href="https://github.com/lithander/GroveScript">GroveScript</a>.

  You can put "supporting open-source software" as the purpose... </br>
  or as you prefer.
