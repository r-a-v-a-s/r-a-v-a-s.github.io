<p>
  I learned the essentials of programming with Python and Tkinter; </br>
  however, I switched to C++ and the Qt framework </br>
  when I started contributing to 
  <a href="https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD">LibreCAD</a>.
</p>

<p>  
  I recently started working on a cross-platform Qt based program </br>
  for rewriting systems (e.g. l-system), which will be open-source.

  You can put "supporting open-source software" as the purpose... </br>
  or as you prefer.
