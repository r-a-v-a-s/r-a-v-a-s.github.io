  My dream is to be able to support myself </br>
  by contributing to open-source software, </br>
  and by growing / selling native food plants.
</p>

<p>
  I learned the essentials of programming with Python and Tkinter; </br>
  however, I'm currently using C++ and the Qt framework. </br>
  My main interests are user interface development and customization. </br>

<p> 
  I've put a lot of effort into improving 
  <a href="https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD">LibreCAD</a> 
  over the past year. </br>
</p>

<p>  
  I'd like to start writing a cross-platform Qt based program </br>
  for l-systems and 
  <a href="https://github.com/lithander/GroveScript">GroveScript</a> soon.
</p>

<p>
  I'm also slowly working on a book about geometric construction.
</p>

  I would really appreciate it! </br>
  You can put "supporting open-source software" as the purpose... or as you prefer.
