    My dream is to be able to support myself by contributing
    to open-source software, and by growing / selling native food plants.
  </p>

  <p>
    The majority of my experience as a programmer is with Python and Tkinter;
    however, I'm currently using C++ and the Qt framework.
    My main interests are user interface development and customization.
